# Aegis AI v2: Decentralized AI Trust, Provenance, & Escrow Platform on Cardano

Aegis AI v2 is a decentralized, privacy-first AI marketplace and model registry built on the **Cardano Preprod Testnet** by team **Seleclaw**. It bridges the gap between healthcare data providers, AI researchers, and commercial entities by offering verifiable dataset provenance, cryptographic escrow payments, and secure model execution checkers.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. AI Data Provenance Graph (9-Node Lineage)
Tracks the complete lifecycle of a dataset, cryptographically verifying each transition on-chain:
* **Hospital (Provider)** ➔ **Dataset v1** ➔ **Dataset Certificate NFT** ➔ **License NFT** ➔ **Training Job** ➔ **AI Model** ➔ **Research Paper** ➔ **Commercial Product** ➔ **Royalties**
* Built with an interactive SVG visualization that pulls live audit records directly from Cardano metadata.

### 2. Multi-Metric Trust Engine
Datasets are evaluated side-by-side on three critical axes:
* **Dataset Trust Score**: Computes completeness, bias ratios, and structural integrity.
* **AI Readiness Index**: Analyzes feature formats, null values, and machine-learning compatibility.
* **Compliance Index**: Verifies regulatory standards like HIPAA (for medical data) or GDPR.

### 3. Secure AI Workspace
A sandboxed VM dashboard that simulates Jupyter Notebook training workflows:
* Mounts licensed datasets directly into secure containers.
* Monitors hardware parameters (GPU Temp, CPU Load, VRAM) in real-time.
* Allows developers to **"Export Model Weights"** to record checkpoint hashes on the Cardano ledger, minting checkpoint certification NFTs.

### 4. Smart Contract Escrow & License NFTs
Automates licensing agreements using Cardano smart contracts:
* Integrates **Lucid Evolution** client-side library to lock dataset metadata/datum in a smart contract.
* On purchase, routes **95% of payment to the dataset creator** and a **5% treasury split** to the platform pool.
* Instantly mints a **CIP-25 compliant License NFT** directly into the buyer's wallet (e.g., Lace, Nami, Eternl).

### 5. Verified AI Model Registry
A structured database linking trained models directly back to their source training datasets:
* Catalogs models by **ML Framework** (PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn) and **Inference Task** (Classification, Segmentation, Detection, etc.).
* Enables audits to verify that models were trained on properly licensed, certified datasets.

### 6. ADA-Weighted Governance
Allows the community to vote on dataset verification rules and direct platform treasury allocations using connected wallets.

## ⚙️ Project Workflow Steps
1. **Secure Upload & Scan**: The data provider uploads a dataset category, price, and raw files. The pipeline scans for virus vectors, scores AI formatting readiness, and checks GDPR compliance.
2. **On-Chain Certification**: The pipeline uploads metadata to **Pinata IPFS** and mints an on-chain **Dataset Certificate NFT** to establish the provenance root.
3. **Escrow Purchase**: A researcher discovers the dataset, inspects its Trust Score and 9-node Provenance Graph, and purchases access. The Lucid Evolution client routes 95% of the ADA to the seller and locks 5% in the Plutus Escrow contract while minting a **License NFT** into the buyer's wallet.
4. **Model Training & Telemetry**: The researcher launches the **Secure AI Workspace**, mounts the licensed data, executes training scripts with active CPU/GPU monitoring, and clicks "Export Model Weights" to mint a checkpoint verification NFT.
5. **Model Registration**: The finalized model is registered on the blockchain ledger, permanently referencing the specific training dataset dependency path.

## ⚙️ Local Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo_url>
   cd Seleclaw
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
